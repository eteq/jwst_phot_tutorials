WebbPSF's installation is a bit more complicated than some of the other tools due to the need for actual data to model the PSFs.  You can try this, which *might* work depending on your setup:

	pip install --upgrade webbpsf

But if you have issues, see https://pythonhosted.org/webbpsf/installation.html for detailed instructions of how to install it.
